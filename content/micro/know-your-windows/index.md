Let's discover forgotten corners on Windows 11. Elements that have been there for decades.

[State of the Windows: How many layers of UI inconsistencies are in Windows 11?](https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/2023/01/01/state-of-the-windows-how-many-layers-of-ui-inconsistencies-are-in-windows-11/)

winget install microsoft.winfile --source winget

*we simply do not have the expertise or resources within the organization to continue to maintain this project*
